## Commit Requirements

Explicit Git Flag Prohibition:

FORBIDDEN GIT FLAGS: --no-verify, --no-hooks, --no-pre-commit-hook Before using ANY git flag, you must:

- [ ] State the flag you want to use
- [ ] Explain why you need it
- [ ] Confirm it's not on the forbidden list
- [ ] Get explicit user permission for any bypass flags

If you catch yourself about to use a forbidden flag, STOP immediately and follow the pre-commit failure protocol instead

Mandatory Pre-Commit Failure Protocol

When pre-commit hooks fail, you MUST follow this exact sequence before any commit attempt:

1. Read the complete error output aloud (explain what you're seeing)
2. Identify which tool failed (ruff, mypy, tests, etc.) and why
3. Explain the fix you will apply and why it addresses the root cause
4. Apply the fix and re-run hooks
5. Only proceed with the commit after all hooks pass

NEVER commit with failing hooks. NEVER use --no-verify. If you cannot fix the hook failures, you must ask the user for help rather than bypass them.

### NON-NEGOTIABLE PRE-COMMIT CHECKLIST (DEVELOPER QUALITY GATES)

Before ANY commit (these are DEVELOPER gates, not code-reviewer gates):

- [ ] All tests pass (run project test suite)
- [ ] Type checking clean (if applicable)  
- [ ] Linting rules satisfied (run project linter)
- [ ] Code formatting applied (run project formatter)
- [ ] **Security review**: security-engineer approval for ALL code changes
- [ ] Clear understanding of specific problem being solved
- [ ] Atomic scope defined (what exactly changes)
- [ ] Commit message drafted (defines scope boundaries)

### MANDATORY COMMIT DISCIPLINE

- **NO TASK IS CONSIDERED COMPLETE WITHOUT A COMMIT**
- **NO NEW TASK MAY BEGIN WITH UNCOMMITTED CHANGES**
- **ALL THREE CHECKPOINTS (A, B, C) MUST BE COMPLETED BEFORE ANY COMMIT**
- Each user story MUST result in exactly one atomic commit
- TodoWrite tasks CANNOT be marked "completed" without associated commit
- If you discover additional work during implementation, create new user story rather than expanding current scope

### Commit Message Template

**All Commits (always use `git commit -s`):**

```
feat(scope): brief description

Detailed explanation of change and why it was needed.

```

### Agent Attribution Requirements

**MANDATORY agent attribution**: When ANY agent assists with work that results in a commit, MUST add agent recognition:

- **REQUIRED for ALL agent involvement**: Any agent that contributes to analysis, design, implementation, or review MUST be credited
- **Multiple agents**: List each agent that contributed on separate lines
- **Agent Hash Mapping System**: **Must Use** `~/devel/tools/get-agent-hash <agent-name>` to get hash for SHORT_HASH in Assisted-By tag.
  - If `get-agent-hash <agent-name>` fails, then stop and ask the user for help.
  - Update mapping with `~/devel/tools/update-agent-hashes` script
- **No exceptions**: Agents MUST NOT be omitted from attribution, even for minor contributions
- The Model doesn't need an attribution like this. It already gets an attribution via the Co-Authored-by line.

### Development Workflow (Project-Appropriate Testing)

**METHODOLOGY SELECTION**: Choose testing approach based on project characteristics (see testing-standards.md for guidance)

**UNIVERSAL WORKFLOW REQUIREMENTS** (regardless of methodology):
1. **Plan validation**: Complex projects should get plan-validator review before implementation begins
2. **Test coverage**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage using project-appropriate methodology
3. **Quality validation**: All tests must pass and validate real functionality (never mock system under test)
4. **COMMIT ATOMIC CHANGE** (following Checkpoint C)
5. **test-specialist approval**: Verify methodology appropriateness and coverage completeness
6. **Refactoring**: Improve code while maintaining test coverage and pristine output
7. **REQUEST CODE-REVIEWER REVIEW** of commit series
8. **Documentation**: Record methodology choice rationale and lessons learned

**METHODOLOGY-SPECIFIC ADAPTATIONS**:
- **Classical TDD**: Red â†’ Green â†’ Refactor cycle with failing tests first
- **Discovery Testing**: Write tests as understanding develops, focus on real functionality
- **Integration-First**: Prioritize integration tests, then unit tests
- **Legacy/Characterization**: Document existing behavior, then improve with test coverage
