# Modal Operation Patterns: Strategic Agent Effectiveness

## MODAL OPERATION FRAMEWORK

**Based on successful patterns from Claude VS Code, Bolt, and CLAUDE.md restructuring. Apply these patterns to enhance agent focus, reduce cognitive load, and improve systematic execution.**

### Core Modal Pattern: PLAN vs ACT Modes

**Inspired by Claude VS Code extension success**:
- **PLAN MODE**: Step back, analyze, strategize, design approach
- **ACT MODE**: Execute with tools, implement solutions, make changes

**Benefits**: 
- Prevents tool execution without strategic thinking
- Reduces cognitive load by separating concerns
- Improves decision quality through systematic planning
- Enables confirmation processes and risk management

### Mode Declaration Protocol

**EXPLICIT MODE DECLARATIONS** (Following CLAUDE.md success pattern):
- **ENTERING [MODE] MODE**: Brief description of what you're doing
- **MODE TRANSITION**: Clear explanation when switching modes
- **MODAL CONSTRAINTS**: Each mode has specific allowed tools and processes

## Agent Modal Operation Patterns

### 🧠 ANALYSIS MODE
**Purpose**: Understanding, exploration, research, strategic thinking

**ENTRY CRITERIA**:
- [ ] Complex problem requiring systematic investigation
- [ ] Unknown domain needing exploration
- [ ] Strategic decisions requiring multi-perspective analysis
- [ ] **MODE DECLARATION**: "ENTERING ANALYSIS MODE: [brief description]"

**ALLOWED TOOLS**: 
- Read, Grep, Glob, WebSearch, WebFetch
- zen MCP tools (thinkdeep, consensus, chat, planner)
- metis mathematical modeling tools
- Journal tools, memory tools

**CONSTRAINTS**:
- **MUST NOT** write, edit, or modify production files
- **MUST NOT** commit or execute system changes
- Focus on understanding and strategy development

**EXIT CRITERIA**:
- Complete understanding achieved OR strategic plan developed
- **MODE TRANSITION**: "EXITING ANALYSIS MODE → [TARGET MODE]"

### ⚡ IMPLEMENTATION MODE  
**Purpose**: Executing approved plans, making changes, building solutions

**ENTRY CRITERIA**:
- [ ] Clear implementation plan from ANALYSIS MODE
- [ ] Approved strategy or approach
- [ ] **MODE DECLARATION**: "ENTERING IMPLEMENTATION MODE: [approved plan summary]"

**ALLOWED TOOLS**:
- Write, Edit, MultiEdit, file operations
- Bash, git operations
- metis execution tools (execute_sage_code)

**CONSTRAINTS**:
- **MUST** follow approved plan precisely
- **MUST** maintain atomic scope discipline
- If plan is flawed → **RETURN TO ANALYSIS MODE**
- No exploratory changes without plan modification

**EXIT CRITERIA**:
- All planned changes complete
- **MODE TRANSITION**: "EXITING IMPLEMENTATION MODE → REVIEW MODE"

### ✅ REVIEW MODE
**Purpose**: Validation, testing, quality assurance, completion verification

**ENTRY CRITERIA**:
- [ ] Implementation complete per approved plan
- [ ] **MODE DECLARATION**: "ENTERING REVIEW MODE: [validation scope]"

**ALLOWED TOOLS**:
- Testing tools, quality gate commands
- zen codereview, zen precommit tools
- Read tools for validation
- Git status and verification commands

**QUALITY GATES** (MANDATORY):
- [ ] All tests pass: `[project test command]`
- [ ] Type checking clean: `[project typecheck command]`
- [ ] Linting satisfied: `[project lint command]`
- [ ] Code formatting applied: `[project format command]`

**EXIT CRITERIA**:
- All quality gates pass successfully
- Changes validated and ready for commit

## Strategic Formatting Principles

### Visual Hierarchy (From Bolt Success)
- **ULTRA IMPORTANT**: Use strategic capitalization for critical instructions
- **Headers and Structure**: Clear markdown hierarchy for quick scanning
- **Code Blocks**: Proper formatting for examples and usage patterns
- **Emphasis**: Bold for critical points, italics for clarification

### Information Architecture (From CLAUDE.md Success)
- **Frontload Critical Information**: Most important constraints and patterns first
- **Inverted Pyramid**: Critical information → Supporting details → Examples
- **Cognitive Load Management**: Break complex information into scannable sections
- **Action-Oriented**: Every section provides clear, actionable guidance

## Tool Documentation Patterns

### One Tool Per Message Confirmation (Claude VS Code Pattern)
**For Critical Operations**:
- Execute one significant tool at a time
- Wait for user confirmation before next major action
- Explain what you're doing and why
- Confirm success before proceeding

**Implementation in Agent Prompts**:
```
For critical operations (system changes, file modifications, commits):
1. Explain what tool you will use and why
2. Execute the single tool
3. Report results and confirm success
4. Wait for user confirmation before next critical action
```

### Comprehensive Tool Examples (Bolt Pattern)
**Every Tool Should Have**:
- Clear purpose statement ("When to Use")
- Detailed capability description
- Practical usage patterns with examples
- Integration guidance with other tools
- Strategic context for selection

### Environmental Context (Both Systems)
**Always Provide**:
- Current operational context and constraints
- System state and environment information
- Directory/file context for operations
- Project-specific requirements and limitations

## Agent Customization Patterns

### Domain-Specific Modal Adaptations

**For Code-Focused Agents** (debug-specialist, performance-engineer):
- **INVESTIGATION MODE**: Analysis with Search tool + zen tools
- **IMPLEMENTATION MODE**: Code changes with quality gates
- **VALIDATION MODE**: Testing and performance verification

**For Architecture Agents** (systems-architect, technical-lead):
- **RESEARCH MODE**: Multi-model consensus building
- **DESIGN MODE**: Planning and architectural decision making  
- **REVIEW MODE**: Design validation and impact assessment

**For Mathematical Agents** (computational-specialist, data-analyst):
- **MODELING MODE**: Mathematical model design with metis tools
- **COMPUTATION MODE**: Mathematical execution and analysis
- **VERIFICATION MODE**: Solution validation and optimization

### Shared Pattern Integration

**All Agents Should Reference**:
- `~/.claude/shared-prompts/zen-mcp-tools-comprehensive.md`
- `~/.claude/shared-prompts/metis-mathematical-computation.md` (for mathematical domains)
- `~/.claude/shared-prompts/analysis-tools-enhanced.md`

**Implementation in Agent Templates**:
```
## Analysis Tools

Read ~/.claude/shared-prompts/analysis-tools-enhanced.md to learn more about enhanced analysis tools

**[Agent-Specific Tool Guidance]**: Additional domain-specific tool selection criteria and usage patterns.
```

## Success Patterns Integration

### Strategic Emphasis (Bolt Pattern)
- Use **CRITICAL**, **MANDATORY**, **IMPORTANT** for key constraints
- Apply visual formatting for immediate recognition
- Frontload constraints and limitations
- Use repetition for critical safety information

### Confirmation Processes (Claude Pattern)  
- Explicit mode declarations and transitions
- User confirmation for critical operations
- Step-by-step validation and verification
- Clear success/failure criteria

### Comprehensive Context (Both Systems)
- Complete environment awareness
- Clear operational constraints and capabilities
- Rich examples and usage guidance
- Integration patterns with other systems

**IMPLEMENTATION AUTHORITY**: These patterns should be systematically applied to ALL agent templates to achieve Claude VS Code and Bolt-level effectiveness in our agent ecosystem.
