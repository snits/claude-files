## Decision Matrix for Tool Selection

### Problem Complexity Assessment

**SIMPLE PROBLEMS** (Use Tier 3 + basic MCP):
- Clear requirements, known solution path
- Single domain focus, minimal unknowns  
- Tools: Standard file ops + basic MCP tools

**COMPLEX PROBLEMS** (Use Tier 1 + domain-specific):
- Multiple unknowns, unclear solution path
- Cross-domain requirements, high impact decisions
- Tools: zen thinkdeep/consensus + domain MCP tools

**CRITICAL DECISIONS** (Use Full MCP Suite):
- High business impact, architectural significance
- Security implications, performance requirements
- Tools: zen consensus + zen thinkdeep + domain tools

### Domain-Specific Selection Patterns

**🔍 Code Analysis & Architecture**:
```
1. serena get_symbols_overview → Understand structure
2. serena find_symbol → Locate components
3. zen thinkdeep → Systematic analysis
4. zen codereview → Expert validation
```

**🐛 Debugging & Problem Investigation**:
```  
1. zen debug → Systematic investigation
2. serena search_for_pattern → Find evidence
3. serena find_referencing_symbols → Trace impacts
4. zen thinkdeep → Root cause analysis (if needed)
```

**📊 Mathematical & Data Analysis**:
```
1. metis design_mathematical_model → Model creation
2. metis execute_sage_code → Implementation  
3. metis verify_mathematical_solution → Validation
4. zen thinkdeep → Complex problem decomposition (if needed)
```

**🏗️ Planning & Architecture Decisions**:
```
1. zen planner → Strategic planning
2. zen consensus → Multi-model validation
3. Domain tools → Implementation support

### Contextual Tool Suggestions

**Embed in Workflow Descriptions**:
- "For complex problems, START with zen thinkdeep before implementation"
- "For architectural decisions, use zen consensus to validate approaches"  
- "For code exploration, begin with serena get_symbols_overview"
- "For mathematical modeling, use metis design_mathematical_model"

### Task-Triggered Tool Recommendations

**Complex Task Indicators → Tool Suggestions**:
- "Unknown problem domain" → zen thinkdeep
- "Multiple solution approaches" → zen consensus  
- "Code architecture analysis" → serena tools + zen codereview
- "Mathematical problem solving" → metis tools + zen validation
- "System debugging" → zen debug + serena code analysis

## Integration Patterns for Maximum Effectiveness

### Sequential Tool Workflows

**Investigation Pattern**:
```
zen thinkdeep (systematic analysis) → 
domain tools (specific discovery) → 
zen thinkdeep (synthesis) →
implementation tools (execution)
```

**Decision Pattern**:
```
zen planner (strategic planning) →
zen consensus (multi-model validation) →
domain tools (implementation support) →
zen codereview (quality validation)
```

**Discovery Pattern**:
```
serena get_symbols_overview (structure) →
serena find_symbol (components) →
zen thinkdeep (analysis) →
serena modification tools (changes)
```

### Cross-Tool Context Transfer

**Maintain Context Across Tools**:
- Use `continuation_id` for zen tools to maintain conversation context
- Reference file paths consistently across serena and zen tools
- Build on previous analysis in subsequent tool calls
- Document findings between tool transitions

### Expert Validation Integration

**When to Use Expert Validation**:
- **Always use** for critical decisions and complex problems
- **Use selectively** for routine tasks with `use_assistant_model: false`
- **Combine validation** from multiple zen tools for comprehensive analysis
