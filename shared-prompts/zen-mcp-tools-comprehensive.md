```

### `mcp__zen__debug` - Systematic Debugging & Root Cause Analysis
**When to Use**: Complex bugs, mysterious errors, performance issues, race conditions, memory leaks
**Key Capabilities**:
- Systematic investigation with hypothesis testing
- Evidence-based debugging with confidence tracking
- Expert analysis and validation of findings

**Usage Pattern**:
```
mcp__zen__debug({
  step: "Investigation approach and evidence",

  hypothesis: "Current root cause theory",
  confidence: "medium",
  relevant_files: ["/absolute/paths/to/relevant/files"],
  model: "gemini-2.5-pro"
})
```

### `mcp__zen__codereview` - Comprehensive Code Review
**When to Use**: Systematic code quality analysis, security review, architectural assessment
**Key Capabilities**:
- Structured review covering quality, security, performance, architecture
- Issue identification with severity levels
- Expert validation and recommendations

**Usage Pattern**:
```
mcp__zen__codereview({
  step: "Review strategy and findings", 
  findings: "Quality, security, performance, architecture discoveries",
  relevant_files: ["/absolute/paths/to/files/for/review"],
  review_type: "full", // full, security, performance, quick
  model: "gemini-2.5-pro"
})
```

### `mcp__zen__precommit` - Git Change Validation
**When to Use**: Multi-repository validation, change impact assessment, completeness verification
**Key Capabilities**:
- Systematic git change analysis
- Security and quality validation
- Impact assessment across repositories

**Usage Pattern**:
```
mcp__zen__precommit({
  step: "Validation strategy and findings",
  findings: "Git changes, modifications, issues discovered", 
  path: "/absolute/path/to/git/repo",
  relevant_files: ["/absolute/paths/to/changed/files"],
  model: "gemini-2.5-pro"
})
```

### `mcp__zen__chat` - Collaborative Thinking & Brainstorming
**When to Use**: Bouncing ideas, getting second opinions, exploring approaches, validating thinking
**Key Capabilities**:
- Multi-model collaboration and idea exploration
- Context-aware brainstorming with file and image support
- Cross-conversation continuity with continuation_id

**Usage Pattern**:
```
mcp__zen__chat({
  prompt: "Your question or idea for collaborative exploration",
  files: ["/absolute/paths/to/relevant/files"],
  model: "gemini-2.5-pro",
  use_websearch: true
})
```

## Strategic Usage Guidelines

### Model Selection Strategy
- **`gemini-2.5-pro`**: Complex reasoning, deep analysis, architectural decisions (1M context + thinking mode)
- **`gemini-2.0-flash`**: Latest capabilities, balanced performance (1M context)
- **`gemini-2.5-flash`**: Quick analysis, simple queries, rapid iterations (1M context)

### When to Use Expert Validation
**ALWAYS use external validation (`use_assistant_model: true`) for**:
- Critical system decisions
- Security-sensitive changes
- Complex architectural choices
- Unknown problem domains

**Use internal validation only when**:
- User explicitly requests faster processing
- Simple validation scenarios
- Low-risk decisions

### Continuation Strategy
**Use `continuation_id` for**:
- Multi-turn analysis sessions
- Building on previous conversations
- Maintaining context across tool calls
- Progressive problem refinement

**Benefits of zen tools over basic tools**:
- **Systematic approach**: Structured investigation vs ad-hoc exploration
- **Expert validation**: Multi-model verification vs single-model analysis  
- **Evidence-based reasoning**: Hypothesis testing vs assumption-based decisions
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Multiple perspectives vs limited viewpoints

## Integration with Other Tools

**zen tools complement**:
- **Metis MCP tools**: zen provides reasoning, metis provides mathematical computation
- **Standard tools**: zen provides systematic framework, standard tools provide implementation

**Tool selection priority**:
1. **For complex analysis**: zen tools first for systematic approach
2. **For code discovery**: Combine zen analysis with Search tool
3. **For mathematical work**: Combine zen reasoning with metis computation
4. **For implementation**: Use zen planning, then standard implementation tools
