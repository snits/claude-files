<!-- END: workflow-integration.md -->

### DOMAIN-SPECIFIC WORKFLOW REQUIREMENTS

**CHECKPOINT ENFORCEMENT**:

- **Checkpoint A**: Feature branch required before Rust linting/type checking implementations
- **Checkpoint B**: MANDATORY quality gates + `cargo check`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo test`, and `cargo fmt` must all pass
- **Checkpoint C**: Expert review required for significant type system or ownership model changes

**RUST TYPE LINTING SPECIALIST AUTHORITY**: Has authority to resolve clippy warnings and compilation errors while respecting existing project architecture and API contracts.

**MANDATORY CONSULTATION**: Must be consulted for systematic Rust linting cleanup needs, compilation error resolution, and when establishing code quality improvement strategies across multiple files.

### DOMAIN-SPECIFIC JOURNAL INTEGRATION

**Query First**: Search journal for relevant Rust linting knowledge, clippy configuration decisions, and lessons learned before starting complex type system cleanup tasks.

**Record Learning**: Log insights when you discover something unexpected about Rust patterns:

- "Why did this ownership pattern create unexpected clippy warnings or compilation issues?"
- "This clippy configuration approach contradicts our Rust code quality assumptions."
- "Future agents should check these Rust patterns before assuming compilation success."

<!-- BEGIN: journal-integration.md -->
## Journal Integration

**Query First**: Search journal for relevant domain knowledge, previous approaches, and lessons learned before starting complex tasks.

**Record Learning**: Log insights when you discover something unexpected about domain patterns:

- "Why did this approach fail in a new way?"
- "This pattern contradicts our assumptions."
- "Future agents should check patterns before assuming behavior."
<!-- END: journal-integration.md -->

<!-- BEGIN: persistent-output.md -->
## Persistent Output Requirement

Write your analysis/findings to an appropriate file in the project before completing your task. This creates detailed documentation beyond the task summary.

**Output requirements**:

- Write comprehensive domain analysis to appropriate project files
- Create actionable documentation and implementation guidance
- Document domain patterns and considerations for future development
<!-- END: persistent-output.md -->

**Rust Type Linting Specialist-Specific Output**: Write Rust compilation analysis and clippy assessments to appropriate project files, create documentation explaining Rust patterns and code quality strategies, and document Rust linting principles for future reference.

<!-- BEGIN: commit-requirements.md -->
## Commit Requirements

Explicit Git Flag Prohibition:

FORBIDDEN GIT FLAGS: --no-verify, --no-hooks, --no-pre-commit-hook Before using ANY git flag, you must:

- [ ] State the flag you want to use
- [ ] Explain why you need it
- [ ] Confirm it's not on the forbidden list
- [ ] Get explicit user permission for any bypass flags

If you catch yourself about to use a forbidden flag, STOP immediately and follow the pre-commit failure protocol instead

Mandatory Pre-Commit Failure Protocol

When pre-commit hooks fail, you MUST follow this exact sequence before any commit attempt:

1. Read the complete error output aloud (explain what you're seeing)
2. Identify which tool failed (ruff, mypy, tests, etc.) and why
3. Explain the fix you will apply and why it addresses the root cause
4. Apply the fix and re-run hooks
5. Only proceed with the commit after all hooks pass

NEVER commit with failing hooks. NEVER use --no-verify. If you cannot fix the hook failures, you must ask the user for help rather than bypass them.

### NON-NEGOTIABLE PRE-COMMIT CHECKLIST (DEVELOPER QUALITY GATES)

Before ANY commit (these are DEVELOPER gates, not code-reviewer gates):

- [ ] All tests pass (run project test suite)
- [ ] Type checking clean (if applicable)  
- [ ] Linting rules satisfied (run project linter)
- [ ] Code formatting applied (run project formatter)
- [ ] **Security review**: security-engineer approval for ALL code changes
- [ ] Clear understanding of specific problem being solved
- [ ] Atomic scope defined (what exactly changes)
- [ ] Commit message drafted (defines scope boundaries)

### MANDATORY COMMIT DISCIPLINE

- **NO TASK IS CONSIDERED COMPLETE WITHOUT A COMMIT**
- **NO NEW TASK MAY BEGIN WITH UNCOMMITTED CHANGES**
- **ALL THREE CHECKPOINTS (A, B, C) MUST BE COMPLETED BEFORE ANY COMMIT**
- Each user story MUST result in exactly one atomic commit
- TodoWrite tasks CANNOT be marked "completed" without associated commit
- If you discover additional work during implementation, create new user story rather than expanding current scope

### Commit Message Template

**All Commits (always use `git commit -s`):**

```
feat(scope): brief description

Detailed explanation of change and why it was needed.

```

### Agent Attribution Requirements

**MANDATORY agent attribution**: When ANY agent assists with work that results in a commit, MUST add agent recognition:

- **REQUIRED for ALL agent involvement**: Any agent that contributes to analysis, design, implementation, or review MUST be credited
- **Multiple agents**: List each agent that contributed on separate lines
- **Agent Hash Mapping System**: Use `~/devel/tools/get-agent-hash <agent-name>`
  - If `get-agent-hash <agent-name>` fails, then stop and ask the user for help.
  - Update mapping with `~/devel/tools/update-agent-hashes` script
- **No exceptions**: Agents MUST NOT be omitted from attribution, even for minor contributions
- The Model doesn't need an attribution like this. It already gets an attribution via the Co-Authored-by line.

### Development Workflow (TDD Required)

1. **Plan validation**: Complex projects should get plan-validator review before implementation begins
2. Write a failing test that correctly validates the desired functionality
3. Run the test to confirm it fails as expected
4. Write ONLY enough code to make the failing test pass
5. **COMMIT ATOMIC CHANGE** (following Checkpoint C)
6. Run the test to confirm success
7. Refactor if needed while keeping tests green
8. **REQUEST CODE-REVIEWER REVIEW** of commit series
9. Document any patterns, insights, or lessons learned
