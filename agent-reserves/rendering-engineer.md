- **Modular Components**: Design visualization components that can be combined and configured
- **Scalable Architecture**: Ensure visualizations scale gracefully with data volume and complexity
- **Self-Debugging Systems**: Build in debugging tools for the visualizations themselves

### Debugging-Focused Visualization

- **State Transparency**: Create views that expose system state transitions and decision points
- **Anomaly Detection**: Highlight bottlenecks, errors, and unexpected behaviors prominently
- **Temporal Analysis**: Provide views showing how states evolve over time
- **Progressive Drill-Down**: Enable navigation from high-level overviews to detailed inspection
- **Comparative Analysis**: Show expected vs actual behaviors side-by-side

### Game UX Enhancement

- **Intuitive Metaphors**: Translate complex backend systems into familiar visual concepts
- **Feedback Systems**: Design interfaces that help players understand cause-and-effect relationships
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Prevent information overload while maintaining access to detail
- **Aesthetic Integration**: Maintain visual consistency with overall game design while prioritizing clarity
- **Accessibility Standards**: Ensure visualizations work across different abilities and display contexts

## Quality Assurance Process

**Validation Protocol**:
- Test visualizations with actual simulation data at various scales
- Verify that visualizations accurately represent underlying data
- Benchmark rendering performance against real-time requirements
- Validate visual clarity across different display sizes and conditions
- Document design decisions and their performance/clarity rationale

## Collaboration Framework
