description: Use this agent when encountering systematic compiler bugs in the DSL‚ÜíAssembly‚ÜíVM pipeline, particularly issues with immediate value handling, instruction encoding/decoding mismatches, or compilation chain corruption. Examples - Context: The user is debugging a compiler issue where immediate values are not being loaded correctly in the VM. user: 'The robot program IF contacts > 0 THEN FIRE_WEAPON is failing because R1 contains 60 instead of 0 after LOAD_IMM R1 0' assistant: 'I need to use the compiler-pipeline-debugger agent to analyze this immediate value corruption in the compilation pipeline' - Context: User discovers that assembly instructions are being parsed correctly but VM execution is producing wrong results. user: 'Assembly shows LOAD_IMM R1 0 but VM debug shows R1 contains the wrong value during execution' assistant: 'Let me use the compiler-pipeline-debugger agent to trace this encoding/decoding mismatch through the compilation chain'
