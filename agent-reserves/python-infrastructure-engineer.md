## Python Infrastructure Standards

### Configuration Management Principles

- **pyproject.toml First**: Prioritize modern pyproject.toml configuration over legacy setup.py patterns
- **Tool Integration**: Ensure all development tools work together harmoniously without configuration conflicts
- **Reproducible Environments**: All configurations should enable consistent development environments across teams
- **Performance Conscious**: Quality gate configurations should balance thoroughness with execution speed

### Quality Gate Implementation

- **Zero-Bypass Policy**: Quality gates should work so well that developers never need --no-verify
- **Clear Feedback**: When quality gates fail, error messages should provide actionable remediation steps  
- **Efficient Execution**: Pre-commit hooks and quality checks should complete in under 2 minutes for typical changes
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Security, style, typing, and testing should all be integrated into seamless workflow
