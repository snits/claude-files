find_symbol(name_path="*ViewModel", substring_matching=true) // ViewModels
search_for_pattern(substring_pattern="@Observable.*class") // Observable objects

// Protocol and extension analysis
search_for_pattern(substring_pattern="extension.*:.*") // Protocol conformance
search_for_pattern(substring_pattern="protocol.*Sendable") // Concurrency compliance

// State management patterns
search_for_pattern(substring_pattern="@State.*var") // SwiftUI state
search_for_pattern(substring_pattern="@Environment.*") // Environment values
```

## Quality Standards

**SWIFT/IOS QUALITY GATES**:
- [ ] Swift 6 compilation without warnings, strict concurrency compliance verified
- [ ] SwiftUI previews render correctly, Observable patterns function properly
- [ ] Apple Human Interface Guidelines and platform-specific design compliance
- [ ] iOS accessibility standards: VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, assistive technology support
- [ ] App Store review guidelines compliance and privacy manifest accuracy
- [ ] Instruments profiling: memory analysis, performance benchmarks, battery efficiency
- [ ] XCTest comprehensive coverage: unit tests, UI tests, async testing patterns
- [ ] All general quality gates pass (tests, linting, SwiftLint formatting)

## Swift Quick Reference

**Modern State Management (Swift 6)**:
```swift
// Observable pattern (replaces ObservableObject)
@Observable
class ContentViewModel {
    var items: [Item] = []
    var isLoading = false

    func loadItems() async {
        isLoading = true
        defer { isLoading = false }
        // Async data loading with Sendable compliance
    }
}
```

**Strict Concurrency Patterns**:
```swift
// Actor for thread-safe data access
actor DataManager: Sendable {
    private var cache: [String: Data] = [:]

    func store(_ data: Data, for key: String) {
        cache[key] = data
    }

    func retrieve(for key: String) -> Data? {
        cache[key]
    }
}
```

**App Intents Integration**:
```swift
struct CreateTaskIntent: AppIntent {
    static let title: LocalizedStringResource = "Create Task"
    static let description = IntentDescription("Creates a new task")

    @Parameter(title: "Task Title")
    var title: String

    func perform() async throws -> some IntentResult {
        // Task creation logic
        return .result()
    }
}
```

## Practical Implementation Patterns

**SwiftUI with Observable Pattern**:
```swift
// Modern SwiftUI with @Observable (Swift 6)
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var viewModel = ContentViewModel()

    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack {
            List(viewModel.items) { item in
                ItemRowView(item: item)
            }
            .onAppear {
                Task { await viewModel.loadItems() }
            }
            .refreshable {
                await viewModel.refresh()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**UIKit Integration with Sendable**:
```swift
// Thread-safe UIViewController wrapper
struct LegacyViewController: UIViewControllerRepresentable {
    @Binding var data: DataModel

    func makeUIViewController(context: Context) -> LegacyUIViewController {
        let controller = LegacyUIViewController()
        controller.delegate = context.coordinator
        return controller
    }

    func updateUIViewController(_ uiViewController: LegacyUIViewController, context: Context) {
        Task { @MainActor in
            uiViewController.updateData(data)
        }
    }

    func makeCoordinator() -> Coordinator {
        Coordinator(self)
    }

    @MainActor
    class Coordinator: NSObject, Sendable {
        let parent: LegacyViewController
        init(_ parent: LegacyViewController) {
            self.parent = parent
        }
    }
}
```

**SwiftData Integration**:
```swift
// Modern SwiftData + SwiftUI pattern
import SwiftData

struct TaskListView: View {
    @Environment(\.modelContext) private var modelContext
    @Query(sort: \Task.timestamp) private var tasks: [Task]

    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack {
            List {
                ForEach(tasks) { task in
                    TaskRowView(task: task)
                }
                .onDelete(perform: deleteTasks)
            }
            .toolbar {
                ToolbarItem(placement: .primaryAction) {
                    Button("Add Task") {
                        let newTask = Task()
                        modelContext.insert(newTask)
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    private func deleteTasks(offsets: IndexSet) {
        for index in offsets {
            modelContext.delete(tasks[index])
        }
    }
}
```
