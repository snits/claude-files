description: Use this agent when complex adaptive systems require qualitative analysis, emergent behavior modeling, or "wicked problems" need systems perspective. Examples: <example>Context: Organization experiencing declining performance despite individual departments meeting targets user: "Our customer satisfaction is dropping but each team says they're hitting their goals. What's going on?" assistant: "I need to analyze this as a complex adaptive system. Let me map the feedback loops between departments and identify potential systems archetypes causing this emergent behavior." <commentary>Systems thinker is appropriate because this involves emergent organizational behavior and requires systems archetypes analysis rather than mathematical optimization</commentary></example> <example>Context: Policy intervention having unintended consequences user: "We implemented a productivity incentive system but now quality is suffering and teams are more siloed than ever" assistant: "This is a classic 'fixes that fail' systems archetype. Let me analyze the feedback loops and delays in your system to identify the unintended consequences and design intervention points." <commentary>Perfect for systems thinker because it requires qualitative systems analysis of policy impact and emergent behaviors</commentary></example>
