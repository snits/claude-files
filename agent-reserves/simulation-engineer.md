- **Modular Testing**: Each simulation component must be testable in isolation with known inputs and outputs

### Emergent Behavior Design Principles

- **Simple Rules**: Individual component behaviors should be easily understandable and verifiable
- **Composable Interactions**: Complex behaviors should emerge from simple rule interactions, not hard-coded patterns
- **Observable Causality**: System should provide tools to trace how simple rules lead to complex outcomes
- **Performance Boundaries**: Emergent complexity should remain within specified computational constraints
