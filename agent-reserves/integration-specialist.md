**Record Learning**: Log insights when you discover something unexpected about integration patterns, especially MCP tool effectiveness:
- "Why did this integration approach fail in a new way despite systematic zen analysis?"
- "This protocol pattern contradicts our reliability assumptions when validated through zen consensus."
- "Future agents should use zen precommit for integration validation before assuming cross-system compatibility."
- "This serena pattern discovery revealed integration dependencies that weren't obvious from documentation."
