## Core Memory Architecture Expertise

### Memory Tier Design

**Cognitive Foundation**: Human memory operates in distinct tiers with specific capacity and temporal constraints based on neuroscience research.

**Working Memory Tier**:
- **Cognitive Basis**: Miller's "7Â±2" chunks (George Miller, 1956) - most humans can hold 5-9 items simultaneously
- **Temporal Limit**: 15-30 seconds without active rehearsal (Peterson & Peterson, 1959)
- **Function**: Active processing, attention management, temporary information holding
- **Implementation**: Fast cache (Redis/in-memory) with aggressive 30-second decay

**Memory Tier Interactions**:
- **Rehearsal Loop**: Working â†’ Working (maintains activation)
- **Encoding**: Working â†’ Semantic/Episodic (consolidation via importance scoring)
- **Retrieval**: Semantic/Episodic â†’ Working (for active processing)
- **Automatization**: Episodic â†’ Procedural (through repetition)

**Semantic Memory Tier**:
- **Structure**: Associative knowledge networks, hierarchical concepts with cross-links
- **Function**: Factual knowledge, conceptual relationships, "what" knowledge
- **Implementation**: Graph database with spreading activation algorithms

**Episodic Memory Tier**:
- **Structure**: Temporal-contextual indexing with rich situational metadata
- **Function**: Autobiographical memory, context retrieval, "when/where" knowledge
- **Implementation**: Time-series database with contextual tags

**Procedural Memory Tier**:
- **Content**: Skills, habits, automated processes, "how" knowledge
- **Function**: Implicit knowledge that improves with practice
- **Implementation**: State machines with usage-based reinforcement learning

### Intelligent Forgetting Strategies

**Importance-Weighted Decay**:
- **Frequency**: More accessed = slower decay (access count normalizes to 1-10 scale)
- **Recency**: Recent access = temporary protection (days since access, max 30)
- **Relevance**: Context-dependent importance scoring (domain relevance 0.1-1.0)
- **Formula**: `decay_rate = base_rate / (frequency * recency * relevance)`
  *Note: All variables normalized to prevent division by zero (minimum values: frequency=1, recency=1, relevance=0.1)*

**Example Scenarios**:
- **Frequently Used API**: frequency=8, recency=1, relevance=1.0 â†’ slow decay (daily use)
- **Old Project Detail**: frequency=2, recency=30, relevance=0.3 â†’ fast decay (rarely relevant)
- **Critical Security Info**: frequency=3, recency=5, relevance=1.0 â†’ medium decay (important but not daily)

**Interference-Based Competition**:
- Similar memories compete for retention
- Newer memories can override older contradictory information
- Context-dependent retrieval prevents inappropriate activation

**Consolidation Processes**:
- Transfer from working to long-term storage
- Schema integration for knowledge organization
- Sleep-like background processing for memory stabilization

### Association Network Architecture

**Spreading Activation Model**:
- Memory nodes with weighted connections
- Activation spreads through network based on relevance
- Context gates activation to relevant domains

**Multi-Modal Associations**:
- Visual, textual, temporal, and conceptual links
- Cross-domain bridges for creative connections
- Dual-coding theory implementation

**Dynamic Relationship Adjustment**:
- Association weights strengthen with co-activation
- Temporal decay of unused connections
- Context-dependent association strength
