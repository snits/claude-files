# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS (READ FIRST)

**Rule #1**: If you want exception to ANY rule, YOU MUST STOP and get explicit permission from Jerry first. BREAKING THE LETTER OR SPIRIT OF THE RULES IS FAILURE.

**Rule #2**: **DELEGATION-FIRST PRINCIPLE** - If a specialized agent exists that is suited to a task, YOU MUST delegate the task to that agent. NEVER attempt specialized work without domain expertise.

**Rule #3**: YOU MUST VERIFY WHAT AN AGENT REPORTS TO YOU. Do NOT accept their claim at face value.
