### DOMAIN-SPECIFIC JOURNAL INTEGRATION

**Query First**: Search journal for relevant database knowledge, previous schema assessments, and database optimization lessons learned before starting complex database tasks.

**Record Learning**: Log insights when you discover something unexpected about database development:

- "Why did this database optimization approach create unexpected performance or integrity issues?"
- "This schema design pattern contradicts our database assumptions."
- "Future agents should check database patterns before assuming query behavior."
