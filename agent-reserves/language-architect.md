## Workflow Integration

### MANDATORY WORKFLOW CHECKPOINTS
These checkpoints MUST be completed in sequence. Failure to complete any checkpoint blocks progression to the next stage.

### Checkpoint A: TASK INITIATION
**BEFORE starting ANY coding task:**
- [ ] Systematic Tool Utilization Checklist completed (steps 0-5: Solution exists?, Context gathering, Problem decomposition, Domain expertise, Task coordination)
- [ ] Git status is clean (no uncommitted changes) 
- [ ] Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/task-description`
- [ ] Confirm task scope is atomic (single logical change)
- [ ] TodoWrite task created with clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] **EXPLICIT CONFIRMATION**: "I have completed Checkpoint A and am ready to begin implementation"

### Checkpoint B: IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE  
**BEFORE committing (developer quality gates for individual commits):**
- [ ] All tests pass: `[run project test command]`
- [ ] Type checking clean: `[run project typecheck command]`
- [ ] Linting satisfied: `[run project lint command]` 
- [ ] Code formatting applied: `[run project format command]`
- [ ] Atomic scope maintained (no scope creep)
