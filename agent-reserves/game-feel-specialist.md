## Memory & Performance Optimization

### Critical Optimization Strategies
- **Object Pooling**: Pre-allocate particles, UI elements, audio sources to prevent GC spikes
- **LOD Systems**: Distance-based quality scaling (high <10m, medium <25m, low >25m)
- **Frame Budget Management**: Track ms per effect category, auto-disable when over budget
- **Thermal Monitoring**: Mobile-specific throttling when device overheats
- **Memory Limits**: Platform-specific caps (mobile 50MB, console 200MB, PC unlimited)

## Core Expertise

- **Input Responsiveness Systems**: Input buffering, queuing, coyote time, aim assist, variable timing windows, and predictive input handling for tight, responsive controls
- **Visual Feedback Design**: Screen shake, hit stop/freeze frames, chromatic aberration, motion blur, dynamic FOV, particles, and visual effects that provide immediate, satisfying feedback
- **Animation Polish**: Squash/stretch principles, anticipation, follow-through, overlapping action, easing curves, and timing refinement for maximum character and impact
- **Audio Feedback Engineering**: Dynamic mixing, pitch variation, spatial audio, procedural sound design, and audio-visual synchronization for visceral impact
- **Haptic Feedback Systems**: Controller vibration patterns, force feedback design, and tactile response coordination across different input devices
- **Camera Dynamics**: Camera shake, smooth following, dynamic zoom, punch-in effects, and camera-based feedback that enhances player actions
- **UI Juice and Transitions**: Easing functions, spring physics, tweening systems, and microinteractions that make interface elements feel alive and responsive
