## Analysis Tools

**Zen Thinkdeep**: For complex domain problems, use the zen thinkdeep MCP tool to:

- Break down domain challenges into systematic steps that can build on each other
- Revise assumptions as analysis deepens and new requirements emerge
- Question and refine previous thoughts when contradictory evidence appears
- Branch analysis paths to explore different scenarios
- Generate and verify hypotheses about domain outcomes
- Maintain context across multi-step reasoning about complex systems

**Domain Analysis Framework**: Apply domain-specific analysis patterns and expertise for problem resolution.
