# Systematic Tool Utilization

## SYSTEMATIC TOOL UTILIZATION CHECKLIST

**BEFORE starting ANY complex task, complete this checklist in sequence:**

**0. Solution Already Exists?** (DRY/YAGNI Applied to Problem-Solving)

- [ ] Search web for existing Rust crates and solutions that solve this problem
- [ ] Check project documentation (00-project/, 01-architecture/, 05-process/) for existing Rust patterns
- [ ] Search journal: `mcp__private-journal__search_journal` for prior Rust solutions to similar problems  
- [ ] Use LSP analysis: `mcp__lsp__project_analysis` to find existing Rust code patterns
- [ ] Verify established crates aren't already handling this requirement
- [ ] Research established Rust patterns and best practices for this domain

**1. Context Gathering** (Before Any Implementation)

- [ ] Journal search for Rust domain knowledge: `mcp__private-journal__search_journal` with relevant terms
- [ ] LSP codebase analysis: `mcp__lsp__project_analysis` for Rust structural understanding
- [ ] Review related Rust documentation and prior architectural decisions

**2. Problem Decomposition** (For Complex Tasks)

- [ ] Use zen thinkdeep: `mcp__zen__thinkdeep` for multi-step Rust analysis
- [ ] Break complex Rust problems into atomic, reviewable increments

**3. Domain Expertise** (When Specialized Knowledge Required)

- [ ] Use metis tools for mathematical computation validation in scientific Rust applications
- [ ] Ensure mathematical accuracy for scientific computing contexts

**4. Task Coordination** (All Tasks)

- [ ] **EXPLICIT CONFIRMATION**: "I have completed Systematic Tool Utilization Checklist and am ready to begin Rust implementation"

## Core Principles

- **Rule #1: Stop and ask Jerry for any exception.**
- DELEGATION-FIRST Principle: Delegate to agents suited to the task.
- **Safety First:** Never execute destructive commands without confirmation. Explain all system-modifying commands.
- **Follow Project Conventions:** Existing Rust code style and patterns are the authority.
- **Smallest Viable Change:** Make the most minimal, targeted Rust changes to accomplish the goal.
- **Find the Root Cause:** Never fix a Rust symptom without understanding the underlying borrow checker or performance issue.
- **Test Everything:** All Rust changes must be validated by tests, preferably following TDD.

## Scope Discipline: When You Discover Additional Rust Issues

When implementing Rust code and you discover new problems:

1. **STOP reactive fixing**
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: What's the underlying borrow checker or ownership issue causing these symptoms?
3. **Scope Assessment**: Same logical Rust problem or different issue?
4. **Plan the Real Fix**: Address Rust root cause, not symptoms
5. **Implement Systematically**: Complete the planned Rust solution

NEVER fall into "whack-a-mole" mode fixing Rust symptoms as encountered.
