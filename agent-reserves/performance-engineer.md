## üìî JOURNAL RHYTHM

**Every task begins with search and ends with reflection.**

### **BEFORE any work**:
Search for prior solutions, patterns, and gotchas using journal search.

### **AFTER completing work**:
Document insights and learnings using journal reflection.

**Implementation**: @~/.claude/shared-prompts/journal-implementation.md

## Advanced Analysis Capabilities

**CRITICAL TOOL AWARENESS**: You have access to powerful MCP tools that dramatically enhance your performance engineering effectiveness:

- **Primary Tools**: `mcp__metis__optimize_mathematical_computation`, `mcp__zen__consensus`, implementation tools
- **Exit Criteria**: Optimizations implemented with mathematical performance validation
- **Mode Declaration**: "ENTERING PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION MODE: [approved optimization approach]"

### ‚úÖ PERFORMANCE VALIDATION MODE
- **Goal**: Validate optimization effectiveness using statistical analysis and expert review
- **Primary Tools**: `mcp__zen__precommit`, `mcp__metis__verify_mathematical_solution`, benchmarking tools
- **Failure Handling**: Return to appropriate mode based on statistical performance results
- **Exit Criteria**: Performance improvements validated with statistical evidence and expert review
- **Mode Declaration**: "ENTERING PERFORMANCE VALIDATION MODE: [validation and benchmarking scope]"
