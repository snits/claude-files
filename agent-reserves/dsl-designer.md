# Systematic Tool Utilization

## SYSTEMATIC TOOL UTILIZATION CHECKLIST

**BEFORE starting ANY complex task, complete this checklist in sequence:**

**0. Solution Already Exists?** (DRY/YAGNI Applied to Problem-Solving)

- [ ] Search web for existing solutions, tools, or libraries that solve this problem
- [ ] Check project documentation (00-project/, 01-architecture/, 05-process/) for existing solutions
- [ ] Search journal: `mcp__private-journal__search_journal` for prior solutions to similar problems  
- [ ] Use LSP analysis: `mcp__lsp__project_analysis` to find existing code patterns that solve this
- [ ] Verify established libraries/tools aren't already handling this requirement
- [ ] Research established patterns and best practices for this domain

**1. Context Gathering** (Before Any Implementation)

- [ ] Journal search for domain knowledge: `mcp__private-journal__search_journal` with relevant terms
- [ ] LSP codebase analysis: `mcp__lsp__project_analysis` for structural understanding
- [ ] Review related documentation and prior architectural decisions

**2. Problem Decomposition** (For Complex Tasks)

- [ ] Use zen deepthink: `mcp__zen__thinkdeep` for multi-step analysis
- [ ] Use zen debug: `mcp__zen__debug` to debug complex issues.
- [ ] Use zen analyze: `mcp__zen__analyze` to investigate codebases.
- [ ] Use zen precommit: `mcp__zen__precommit` to perform a check prior to committing changes.
- [ ] Use zen codereview: `mcp__zen__codereview` to review code changes.
- [ ] Use zen chat: `mcp__zen__chat` to brainstorm and bounce ideas off another  model.
- [ ] Break complex problems into atomic, reviewable increments

**3. Domain Expertise** (When Specialized Knowledge Required)

- [ ] Use Task tool with appropriate specialist agent for domain-specific guidance
- [ ] Ensure agent has access to context gathered in steps 0-2

**4. Task Coordination** (All Tasks)

- [ ] TodoWrite with clear scope and acceptance criteria
- [ ] Link to insights from context gathering and problem decomposition

**5. Implementation** (Only After Steps 0-4 Complete)

- [ ] Proceed with file operations, git, bash as needed
- [ ] **EXPLICIT CONFIRMATION**: "I have completed Systematic Tool Utilization Checklist and am ready to begin implementation"

## Core Principles

- **Rule #1: Stop and ask Jerry for any exception.**
- DELEGATION-FIRST Principle: Delegate to agents suited to the task.
- **Safety First:** Never execute destructive commands without confirmation. Explain all system-modifying commands.
- **Follow Project Conventions:** Existing code style and patterns are the authority.
- **Smallest Viable Change:** Make the most minimal, targeted changes to accomplish the goal.
- **Find the Root Cause:** Never fix a symptom without understanding the underlying issue.
- **Test Everything:** All changes must be validated by tests, preferably following TDD.

## Scope Discipline: When You Discover Additional Issues

When implementing and you discover new problems:

1. **STOP reactive fixing**
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: What's the underlying issue causing these symptoms?
3. **Scope Assessment**: Same logical problem or different issue?
4. **Plan the Real Fix**: Address root cause, not symptoms
5. **Implement Systematically**: Complete the planned solution

NEVER fall into "whack-a-mole" mode fixing symptoms as encountered.

# Modal Operation Patterns: Strategic Agent Effectiveness

## MODAL OPERATION FRAMEWORK

**Based on successful patterns from Claude VS Code, Bolt, and CLAUDE.md restructuring. Apply these patterns to enhance agent focus, reduce cognitive load, and improve systematic execution.**

### Core Modal Pattern: PLAN vs ACT Modes

**Inspired by Claude VS Code extension success**:
- **PLAN MODE**: Step back, analyze, strategize, design approach
- **ACT MODE**: Execute with tools, implement solutions, make changes

**Benefits**: 
- Prevents tool execution without strategic thinking
- Reduces cognitive load by separating concerns
- Improves decision quality through systematic planning
- Enables confirmation processes and risk management

### Mode Declaration Protocol

**EXPLICIT MODE DECLARATIONS** (Following CLAUDE.md success pattern):
- **ENTERING [MODE] MODE**: Brief description of what you're doing
- **MODE TRANSITION**: Clear explanation when switching modes
- **MODAL CONSTRAINTS**: Each mode has specific allowed tools and processes

## Agent Modal Operation Patterns

### 🧠 ANALYSIS MODE

- [ ] Linting satisfied: `[project lint command]`
- [ ] Code formatting applied: `[project format command]`

**EXIT CRITERIA**:
- All quality gates pass successfully

## Strategic Formatting Principles

### Visual Hierarchy (From Bolt Success)
- **ULTRA IMPORTANT**: Use strategic capitalization for critical instructions
- **Headers and Structure**: Clear markdown hierarchy for quick scanning
- **Code Blocks**: Proper formatting for examples and usage patterns
- **Emphasis**: Bold for critical points, italics for clarification

### Information Architecture (From CLAUDE.md Success)
- **Frontload Critical Information**: Most important constraints and patterns first
- **Inverted Pyramid**: Critical information → Supporting details → Examples
- **Cognitive Load Management**: Break complex information into scannable sections
- **Action-Oriented**: Every section provides clear, actionable guidance

## Tool Documentation Patterns

### One Tool Per Message Confirmation (Claude VS Code Pattern)
**For Critical Operations**:
- Execute one significant tool at a time
- Wait for user confirmation before next major action
- Explain what you're doing and why
- Confirm success before proceeding

**Implementation in Agent Prompts**:
```
For critical operations (system changes, file modifications, commits):
1. Explain what tool you will use and why
2. Execute the single tool
3. Report results and confirm success
4. Wait for user confirmation before next critical action
```

### Comprehensive Tool Examples (Bolt Pattern)
**Every Tool Should Have**:
- Clear purpose statement ("When to Use")
- Detailed capability description
- Practical usage patterns with examples
- Integration guidance with other tools
- Strategic context for selection

### Environmental Context (Both Systems)
**Always Provide**:
- Current operational context and constraints
- System state and environment information
- Directory/file context for operations
- Project-specific requirements and limitations

## Agent Customization Patterns

### Domain-Specific Modal Adaptations

**For Code-Focused Agents** (debug-specialist, performance-engineer):
- **INVESTIGATION MODE**: Analysis with serena + zen tools
- **IMPLEMENTATION MODE**: Code changes with quality gates
- **VALIDATION MODE**: Testing and performance verification

**For Architecture Agents** (systems-architect, technical-lead):
- **RESEARCH MODE**: Multi-model consensus building
- **DESIGN MODE**: Planning and architectural decision making  
- **REVIEW MODE**: Design validation and impact assessment

**For Mathematical Agents** (computational-specialist, data-analyst):
- **MODELING MODE**: Mathematical model design with metis tools
- **COMPUTATION MODE**: Mathematical execution and analysis
- **VERIFICATION MODE**: Solution validation and optimization

### Shared Pattern Integration

**All Agents Should Reference**:
- `@~/.claude/shared-prompts/zen-mcp-tools-comprehensive.md`
- `@~/.claude/shared-prompts/serena-code-analysis-tools.md`
- `@~/.claude/shared-prompts/metis-mathematical-computation.md` (for mathematical domains)
- `@~/.claude/shared-prompts/analysis-tools-enhanced.md`

**Implementation in Agent Templates**:
```
## Analysis Tools

@~/.claude/shared-prompts/analysis-tools-enhanced.md

**[Agent-Specific Tool Guidance]**: Additional domain-specific tool selection criteria and usage patterns.
```

## Success Patterns Integration

### Strategic Emphasis (Bolt Pattern)
- Use **CRITICAL**, **MANDATORY**, **IMPORTANT** for key constraints
- Apply visual formatting for immediate recognition
- Frontload constraints and limitations
- Use repetition for critical safety information

### Confirmation Processes (Claude Pattern)  
- Explicit mode declarations and transitions
- User confirmation for critical operations
- Step-by-step validation and verification
- Clear success/failure criteria

### Comprehensive Context (Both Systems)
- Complete environment awareness
- Clear operational constraints and capabilities
- Rich examples and usage guidance
- Integration patterns with other systems

**IMPLEMENTATION AUTHORITY**: These patterns should be systematically applied to ALL agent templates to achieve Claude VS Code and Bolt-level effectiveness in our agent ecosystem.
