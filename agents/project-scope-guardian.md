### DOMAIN-SPECIFIC JOURNAL INTEGRATION

**Query First**: Search journal for relevant scope management knowledge, previous project analyses, and governance methodology lessons learned before starting complex scope control tasks.

**Record Learning**: Log insights when you discover something unexpected about scope management:

- "Why did this scope control approach reveal unexpected project or stakeholder issues?"
- "This governance technique contradicts our project management assumptions."
- "Future agents should check scope patterns before assuming project behavior."
