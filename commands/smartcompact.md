Generate a concise, strategic compact string for /compact based on our current conversation context. Focus on:

**Strategic Context Preservation:**
- Current project status and operational state
- Repository state: current branch, uncommitted changes, files being worked on
- Key architectural decisions and technical approaches
- Active problems being solved and their context
- Important discoveries and lessons learned
- Active agent definitions and their established patterns
- Current workflow stage (planning/implementation/review/checkpoint status)
- Recent journal insights relevant to current work

**Compress These Details:**
- Detailed debugging steps and error messages
- Routine setup and installation processes  
- Lengthy code examples (keep patterns, compress specifics)
- Historical context that doesn't inform current work
- Repetitive tool outputs and status messages

**Memory Integration:**
Search recent journal entries for key insights that should be preserved across context resets, particularly technical discoveries, failed approaches, and established working patterns.

**Output Format:**
Provide a concise compact string that Jerry can copy and use directly with /compact, optimized to preserve essential context while efficiently managing token usage and maintaining continuity across sessions.
