Okay Claude, create a session-handoff.md in the project root directory (or worktree root directory if working in a worktree). If one exists, remove it and replace it with the new edition. Document what was accomplished this session, what the next step is, the location of the plan being implemented, the location of the worktreee if being used, and any patterns or useful information to provide context to start the next step.
